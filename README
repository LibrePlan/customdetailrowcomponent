ABOUT

Since version 5 of ZK (www.zkoss.org) there are some components that are no
longer free as they used to be on their latest stable release (version 3.6.4).
One of those components is detail, which allows grids to behave as trees,
allowing a row to expand and show more details with respect to the row item.

This component is a fork from its GPL version at ZK 3.6.4 and initially used at
Navalplan (www.navalplan.org) but it's free to use and modify by whoever wants
as it's released under the AGPL license (so remember to share your changes).

NOTES

To run the example code type: mvn jetty:run
And to install the component: mvn install.
